# Status

* Many APIs are still unimplemented (please file an issue!)
* RTM events are not covered entirely yet (please file an issue!)

Missing parts are missing only because the author does not have immediate need for them. With proper prodding, I will gladly take on implementing them.

Please see [#4](https://github.com/lestrrat-go/slack/issues/4) for a list of currently known unimplemented methods.

# Features

## Auto-generated API

All of the APIs in this library is generated by a tool, reducing human errors.

## Supports Google App Engine

Google App Engine does not allow the use of raw `net/http` clients. Instead you need to use the `urlfetch` package.
This library allows you to pass the HTTP client that it should use:

```go
ctx := appengine.NewContext(r)
httpCl := urlfetch.Client(ctx)
slackCl := slack.New(token, slack.WithToken(httpCl))
```

## Google API style library

All of the APIs in this library resemble that of google.golang.org/api, and is very predictable across all APIs.

## Full support for context.Context

The API is designed from the ground up to integrate well with context.Context.

## Mock Server

A server that mocks the Slack API calls is available, which should help you integrate your applications with Slack while you are still in development.

Note: many mock methods are still NOT properly implemented. Please see `server/mockserver/mockserver.go` and `server/mockserver/response.go`. PRs welcome!

## Slack Proxy

Sometimes you want a tool that talks to the Slack API, but don't want to really
send messages. We have a simple server that can intercept methods that have
side effects, while sending everything else to the real Slack API server, called
slaproxy (you can compile it from `cmd/slaproxy/slaproxy.go`)

We even have Docker container for it

```
docker run -e SLACK_TOKEN=xxx -e SLACK_LISTEN=:9999 lestrrat/slaproxy
```

# Synopsis

Simple REST Client:

```go
package slack_test

import (
  "context"
  "fmt"
  "os"

  "github.com/lestrrat-go/slack"
)

func ExampleClient() {
  ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context.Background())
  defer cancel()

  token := os.Getenv("SLACK_TOKEN")
  cl := slack.New(token)

  // check if we are connected
  authres, err := cl.Auth().Test().Do(ctx)
  if err != nil {
    fmt.Printf("failed to test authentication: %s\n", err)
    return
  }
  fmt.Printf("%#v\n", authres)

  // simplest possible message
  chatres, err := cl.Chat().PostMessage("@username").
    Text("Hello, World!").
    Do(ctx)
  if err != nil {
    fmt.Printf("failed to post messsage: %s\n", err)
    return
  }
  fmt.Printf("%#v\n", chatres)
}
```

A mock server

```
package slack_test

import (
  "context"
  "net/http"
  "time"

  "github.com/lestrrat-go/slack"
  "github.com/lestrrat-go/slack/server"
  "github.com/lestrrat-go/slack/server/mockserver"
)

func ExampleMockServer() {
  token := "..."
  h := mockserver.New(mockserver.WithToken(token))
  s := server.New()

  h.InstallHandlers(s)

  srv := http.Server{Handler: s, Addr: ":8080"}
  go srv.ListenAndServe()
  ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 10*time.Second)
  defer cancel()
  cl := slack.New(token, slack.WithAPIEndpoint("http://localhost:8080"))
  if _, err := cl.Auth().Test().Do(ctx); err != nil {
    log.Printf("failed to call auth.test: %s", err)
    return
  }

  srv.Shutdown(ctx)
}
```

# RTM

See the [README in the rtm/ directory](./rtm/README.md).

# Calling Conventions

The API is constructed along the same lines of Google API Go libraries (https://google.golang.org/api), so if you are familiar with that style you should have no problem. But if you have not used their API, I'm sure you're confused - I know I was when I first saw their API.

This section will walk you through how the APIs in this REST client generally work. The basic idea is that you have a central client, which you can create via `New`:

```go
  client := slack.New(token)
```

The client is nothing but a placeholder for other "services". For example, to
use the slack APIs for `chat.*` endpoints, lookup the `ChatService` object
which can be obtained by calling the `Chat()` method:

```go
  service := client.Chat()
```

The `ChatService` object can construct an intermediate object, which are called
the `Call` objects. These objects exist to accumulate parameters that you want to
ultimately call the API endpoint with.

In the initial call to construct the objects, you will have to enter the **mandatory** parameters. For example, to start a `PostMessage` call (which is supposed to access `chat.postMessage` endpoint), you do:

```go
  call := service.PostMessage(channel)
```

The `channel` parameter is required, so you must pass that to the `PostMessage` method (you would think that `text` is always required, but you could either provide `text`, or an _attachment_ with text, so it's not always the case)

Once you have the `call` object, you can specify additional parameters which are
optional. The following would specify a `text` attribute for this call.

```go
  call.Text(yourMessage)
```

Finally, when you are done tweaking your call object, you should call `Do`, which will fire the actual request.

```go
  res, err := call.Do(ctx)
```

And you are done. Don't for get to pass a `context.Context` to all `Do` calls.

Also, for your convenience these `call` object methods can all be chained. So the above example could look like the following:

```go
  res, err := client.Chat().PostMessage(channel).Text(yourMessage).Do(ctx)
```

# Hacking

To add REST endpoints, edit [endpoints.json](endpoints.json), and then run 

```
make generate
```

New code will be generated, and you can run your tests, or compile your program
with it.

If you want to dump what go-slack is sending/receiving you can compile your
program using the "debug0" tag. Just be aware that it will be very noisy:

```
go build -tags debug0 -o your-program your-code.go 
```
